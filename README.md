#Introduction
Welcome to Maestro, the real-time classroom call and response tool!  Maestro allows you to create a virtual classroom, right alongside your real one.  Each room has a unique #classtag that you set yourself.  Once your students join you, you can ask them questions, and they can send you their responses instantly.
Maestro is designed for quick, on-the-fly assessment of your students, to inform and guide your teaching as you do it!

#Teacher
Press begin, and allow Maestro to see your basic Google information.  Maestro will prompt you to enter a #classtag.  Enter anything you like. As long as nobody else is currently using that tag, Maestro will recognize you’re a teacher starting a new classroom.
Choose from the four question types:

- This/That - Choose between two different words or phrases.  This defaults to a true/false.
- Dragger - Drag a slider on a ruled scale between two different words or phrases.  Answer is 1-10
- Multiple Choice/Select - A multiple choice or select question with 3-6 options (A-F)
- Type-In - Students type in their answers.

Click on the question title to change the question’s text.  Click on different parts of the question to adjust them.  When you’re ready, click the broadcast button.

You’ll see a grid of empty boxes.  As your students submit answers, the boxes will fill with their names, answers, and comments.  The color of their box, represents the difficulty that they rated the question (green - easy, yellow - medium, red - hard).

You can click on a student’s box to get enlarged detail.  In the detail information, you can click the comment button to send the student a comment on their answer. Type your comment and press enter to send, escape to cancel.

#Student

A student logs in with their Google Apps for Education account.  Once logged in, they should wait for the #classtag that you provide.  The student software will wait until you’ve posted a question, and then display the question.  Students can click on the question parts to answer.  They can also add comments to their answer, before clicking the broadcast button.

Once they’ve broadcast their answer to you, their software will wait until you’ve posted the next question.
